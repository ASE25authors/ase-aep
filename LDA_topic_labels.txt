TITLE: LDA Topic Labels - Descriptive Mapping (k = 12)

Purpose
-------
This file provides an illustrative, analyst-facing mapping from LDA topics to short human-readable labels.
Labels are descriptive examples intended to support downstream interpretation and may be adapted to specific domains.
For each topic we report a concise label, the top indicative tokens observed, and a brief rationale.

Method note
-----------
Model: LDA on explanation corpus (preprocessing: lowercasing, tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, bigram detection).
Selection: topics set to k = 12 based on Cv coherence (plateau at k = 12).
Tokens: taken from the top-weighted terms per topic.
